# Getting Started with DevOps

A beginner-friendly guide to starting your DevOps journey.

## 🎯 Where to Start?

If you're completely new to DevOps, follow this path:

### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. **Learn Git basics** (2-3 days)
   - Create a GitHub account
   - Complete the [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) interactive tutorial
   - Create your first repository

2. **Choose a programming language** (1 week)
   - Recommended: Python for beginners
   - Complete at least 5 chapters of [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

3. **Linux fundamentals** (3-4 days)
   - Install Ubuntu in VirtualBox or use WSL2 (Windows)
   - Practice 20 essential commands daily

### Week 3-4: Build Your First Project
Create a simple web application:
- Use Python/Flask or Node.js
- Track it with Git
- Deploy it on a Linux server

### Week 5-8: Containers
1. Learn Docker (2 weeks)
2. Containerize your web app
3. Learn Docker Compose
4. Run multi-container applications

### Week 9-12: CI/CD
1. Set up GitHub Actions
2. Create automated tests
3. Deploy automatically on push

### Month 4-6: Advanced Topics
- Kubernetes basics
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Cloud provider (AWS/Azure)
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)

## 🛠️ Essential Tools Setup

### 1. Install Git
```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install git

# Windows
# Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
```

### 2. Set up a Code Editor
- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install extensions: Python, Docker, GitLens

### 3. Install Docker
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows/macOS
- Follow [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for Linux

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Practice Daily**: Even 30 minutes daily is better than 5 hours once a week
2. **Build Projects**: Theory is important, but hands-on experience is crucial
3. **Document Your Journey**: Keep notes and blog about what you learn
4. **Join Communities**: 
   - [DevOps subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/)
   - [DevOps Discord servers](https://discord.com/)
   - Local DevOps meetups
5. **Don't Skip Fundamentals**: Linux and networking are critical
6. **Use AI Responsibly**: Tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are great helpers, but ensure you understand the code they generate. Don't copy-paste blindly!

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Trying to learn everything at once** - Focus on one tool at a time
2. **Skipping the basics** - Don't jump to Kubernetes without understanding Docker
3. **Not practicing enough** - Reading is not enough; you must do
4. **Ignoring version control** - Learn Git properly from the start
5. **Tutorial hell** - Build projects, don't just follow tutorials
