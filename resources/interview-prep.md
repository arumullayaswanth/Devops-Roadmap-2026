## General DevOps Concepts

### Q1: What is DevOps?
**Answer**: DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high quality. It emphasizes:
- Automation
- Collaboration
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment
- Monitoring and feedback
- Rapid iteration

### Q2: What are the key principles of DevOps?
**Answer**:
1. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks
2. **Continuous Integration**: Integrate code frequently
3. **Continuous Delivery**: Deploy frequently and reliably
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of applications and infrastructure
5. **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between teams
6. **Infrastructure as Code**: Manage infrastructure through code
7. **Feedback Loops**: Quick feedback from production to development

### Q3: What is the difference between Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, and Continuous Deployment?
**Answer**:
- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Automatically building and testing code every time a change is committed
- **CD (Continuous Delivery)**: Code is always in a deployable state; deployment to production requires manual approval
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Every change that passes tests is automatically deployed to production

### Q4: What are microservices?
**Answer**: Microservices is an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services that:
- Run in their own processes
- Communicate via APIs (usually HTTP/REST or message queues)
- Can be deployed independently
- Are organized around business capabilities
- Can use different technologies/languages

**Benefits**:
- Scalability
- Flexibility
- Easier maintenance
- Faster deployment

**Challenges**:
- Increased complexity
- Distributed system challenges
- Monitoring difficulties
- Data consistency

## Git & Version Control

### Q5: What is Git rebase and how is it different from merge?
**Answer**:
- **Merge**: Combines branches by creating a new merge commit, preserving history
- **Rebase**: Moves or combines commits to a new base, creating a linear history

**When to use**:
- **Merge**: For integrating feature branches into main
- **Rebase**: For cleaning up local commits before pushing

```bash
# Merge
git merge feature-branch

# Rebase
git rebase main
```

### Q6: What is a Git conflict and how do you resolve it?
**Answer**: A conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes because the same lines were modified in different branches.

**Resolution steps**:
1. Identify conflicted files: `git status`
2. Open files and look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
3. Manually edit to keep desired changes
4. Remove conflict markers
5. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
6. Complete merge/rebase: `git commit` or `git rebase --continue`

### Q7: What are Git hooks?
**Answer**: Git hooks are scripts that run automatically at specific points in the Git workflow.

**Common hooks**:
- `pre-commit`: Runs before commit (linting, tests)
- `pre-push`: Runs before push
- `post-commit`: Runs after commit
- `pre-receive`: Runs on server before accepting push

**Example use cases**:
- Code formatting
- Running tests
- Preventing commits to protected branches
- Sending notifications

## Linux & Scripting

### Q8: How do you check disk space usage on Linux?
**Answer**:
```bash
# Overall disk usage
df -h

# Directory sizes
du -sh /path/*

# Largest directories
du -h /path | sort -rh | head -10
```

### Q9: How do you find and kill a process?
**Answer**:
```bash
# Find process
ps aux | grep <process-name>
# or
pgrep <process-name>

# Kill process
kill <PID>
kill -9 <PID>  # Force kill

# Kill by name
killall <process-name>
pkill <process-name>
```

### Q10: What is the difference between hard link and soft link?
**Answer**:
- **Hard Link**: Direct reference to the inode; deleting original doesn't affect hard link
- **Soft Link (Symbolic)**: Pointer to filename; breaks if original is deleted

```bash
# Hard link
ln original.txt hardlink.txt

# Soft link
ln -s original.txt softlink.txt
```

### Q11: Explain file permissions in Linux
**Answer**: Permissions are represented by 10 characters: `-rwxrwxrwx`

- First character: File type (`-` file, `d` directory)
- Next 3: Owner permissions (read, write, execute)
- Next 3: Group permissions
- Last 3: Others permissions

**Numeric representation**:
- Read (r) = 4
- Write (w) = 2
- Execute (x) = 1

```bash
chmod 755 file  # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file  # rw-r--r--
```

### Q12: How do you troubleshoot high CPU usage?
**Answer**:
1. Identify process: `top` or `htop`
2. Check specific process: `ps aux | grep <PID>`
3. View threads: `top -H -p <PID>`
4. Check system logs: `dmesg`, `journalctl`
5. Use profiling tools: `perf`, `strace`

## Docker & Containers

### Q13: What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?
**Answer**:
- **Image**: Read-only template containing application code, libraries, and dependencies. Built from Dockerfile.
- **Container**: Running instance of an image. Writable layer on top of image.

```bash
# Image is like a class, container is like an object
docker run <image>  # Creates container from image
```

### Q14: Explain Docker networking modes
**Answer**:
1. **Bridge** (default): Private network on host, containers communicate via bridge
2. **Host**: Container shares host's network namespace, no isolation
3. **None**: No networking, complete isolation
4. **Overlay**: Multi-host networking for Swarm
5. **Macvlan**: Assign MAC address to container, appears as physical device

```bash
docker run --network=bridge myapp
docker run --network=host myapp
```

### Q15: How do you reduce Docker image size?
**Answer**:
1. **Use smaller base images**: Alpine instead of Ubuntu
2. **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime stages
3. **Minimize layers**: Combine RUN commands
4. **Remove unnecessary files**: Clean cache, temp files
5. **Use .dockerignore**: Exclude unnecessary files

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build example
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --production
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### Q16: What is Docker Compose and when do you use it?
**Answer**: Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications using YAML files.

**Use cases**:
- Development environments
- Automated testing
- Single-host deployments
- Microservices architecture locally

**Example**:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  db:
    image: postgres:13

kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mysql
spec:
  serviceName: mysql
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:5.7

kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Check logs
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous  # Previous container

# Check events
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# Execute into pod (if running)
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh

# Common issues:
# - Image pull errors (wrong image, auth)
# - Resource limits
# - ConfigMap/Secret not found
# - Volume mount issues
```
